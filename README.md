# DataStructures-IE-Tech

Welcome to my personal repository, showcasing my journey through the Data Structures & Algorithms course at IE School of Science & Technology. Delving deeper into the foundational principles of data structures and algorithms; with a focus on practical implementation in Python tackling the complexities inherent in these topics.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Implement various data structures from scratch in Python, understanding their intricacies.
- Engage in a thorough exploration of key data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues, Hash tables, Trees, and Graphs.
- Master and apply algorithms for Searching, Sorting, and Traversal in real-world scenarios.

## Projects Overview

Contained within this repository are two significant projects, both independently conceived:

### Exploring Binary Search Trees
- `/BinarySearchTreeImplementation.ipynb`: This project focuses on binary search trees, detailing their creation, manipulation, and the fundamental operations such as insertion, search, and traversal.

### Advanced Graph Theory Applications
- `/GraphTheoryExploration.ipynb`: This project addresses graph theory,  its construction and manipulation, management of vertices and edges, and the implementation of graph-based search algorithms within practical contexts. 

Each notebook is meticulously documented, featuring in-depth explanations of the concepts applied, thorough code implementations, and insights into my problem-solving approaches. Embarking on these projects has greatly enriched my understanding and proficiency in data structures and algorithms, bolstering my analytical and problem-solving skills.
