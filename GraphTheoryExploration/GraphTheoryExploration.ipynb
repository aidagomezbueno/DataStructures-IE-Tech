    "\n",
    "#### Greedy Search\n",
    "In `Greedy Search`, the algorithm selects the path that appears to be leading most directly to the goal state at each step. It **doesn’t take into account** the **cost already incurred** to reach the current node, which could lead to **suboptimal solutions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heuristic (h(n))**: An estimation of the cost from node n to the goal.\n",
    "- **Selection Criterion**: Choose the node that has the **smallest estimated cost** to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A* Search\n",
    "`A* Search` is an extension of Greedy Search that includes both the **cost to reach the current node**, and the **estimated cost to reach the goal**; this algorithm is less short-sighted than Greedy Search as it aims to **minimize** the **total estimated path cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heuristic (h(n))**: An estimation of the cost from node n to the goal.\n",
    "- **Cost function (g(n))**: The actual cost from the start node to node n.\n",
    "- **Evaluation function (f(n))**: f(n) = g(n) + h(n).\n",
    "- **Selection Criterion**: Choose the node with the **smallest value of f(n)**; A* looks for the lowest-cost path considering both the **accumulated cost** so far and the **estimated cost** to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `Greedy Search` can quickly find a path to the goal by following the seemingly best immediate choice, it can be misled by paths that start out promising but lead to high costs later; `A* Search` provides a more balanced and informed approach leading to more optimal solutions in complex search spaces."
